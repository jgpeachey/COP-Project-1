if you want to test YOUR code, (1) you need to make sure you're on eustis3.eecs.ucf.edu, not eustis.eecs.ucf.edu, (2) make sure Makefile, tester.sh, complex.txt, complexout.txt, basicish.txt, basicishout.txt, driver.c, compiler.h, lex.o, parser.o, vm.c are all uploaded to eustis3 and you're in the file they're in on the terminal, (3) run the command "make" to compile and check for any compile time errors, (4) run the command "bash tester.sh" to test your code, (5) if you get sad faces, you can check individual test cases, by doing "./a.out complex.txt -v <<< '7 6' > output.txt" followed by the command "diff -w -B output.txt complexout.txt" for the complex test OR "./a.out basicish.txt <<< '8' > output.txt" followed by "diff -w -B output.txt basicishout.txt" for the basic test (6) if you actually want to see the output your code is giving, drop the "> output.txt" from the first commands [this can help you identify the presence of infinite loops] (7) if you want to write your own test cases, you can do "./magic input.txt -v > inputout.txt"
